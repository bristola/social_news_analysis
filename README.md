# Social and News Media Analysis
### By: Austin Bristol

This project was completed for a senior thesis project at Allegheny College. The system was written in Python 3, and uses a suite of technologies to perform sentiment analysis of social media and news data.

## Overview

This software system allows users to collect large amounts of media data from Twitter and various news sources, and analyzes this information to extract valuable insights in the sentiment that users display on the platforms. By using a easy-to-use web interface, users can set up a cluster of AWS machines to perform the analytics with a click of a button. Also, the user can easily query the system for whatever search topic that they want to perform analytics on, as well as saving previous results to be viewed later. Visualizations are produced as a result of the analytics, and can be used to gain insights on the input topic.

### Examples

Below shows various example visualizations that are produced by this software system. Include, overall data visualization, a bar graph, pie chart, line graph, and emoticon table.



Also, you can view how the system works all together by viewing the following [demo video](https://youtu.be/oO-sEbG8oZI).
